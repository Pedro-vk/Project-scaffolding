# Project Scaffolding
## Architecture proposal for Angular 1.x projects

*Node:* this scaffolding has samples files.

### Run or compile the project
Serve the project on `localhost:3000`
```
npm run serve
```

Compile the project on `dist` folder
```
npm run dist
```

Run the linters and test
```
npm test
```
#### Future planning
* Add Jasmine test over Karma
* Add Egeo, fonts and fonts-icons
* (?) Generate the font-icon from SVG files
